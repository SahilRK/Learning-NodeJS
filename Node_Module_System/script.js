//NODE MODULE SYSTEM
//This allows us to load modules into our app and perform interesting tasks. They allow us to load and access code from three places.
//1) Core Node modules
//2) Third party node modules
//3) Self/User created modules.
//Some modules are globally available such as console which we dont need to import. Whereas there are other modules that need to be imported inorder to use their functionality
